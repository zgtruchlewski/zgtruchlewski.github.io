As a Europeanist and political economist, I am interested in the politics of European integration, polity formation, and macroeconomic policies (e.g., solidarity, austerity), the Euro and Central-Eastern Europe and Bayesian statistics. You can find my publications [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5hv_rE0AAAAJ&hl=fr).
