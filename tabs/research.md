As a Europeanist and political economist, I am interested in the politics of European integration, polity formation, and macroeconomic policies (e.g., solidarity, austerity), the Euro and Central-Eastern Europe and Bayesian statistics. I have [published](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5hv_rE0AAAAJ&hl=fr) on the comparative politics of taxation, the political economy of the Euro, the external governance of the Euro, on fiscal policy in Germany and Central-Eastern European politics.
