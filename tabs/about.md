I am a tenured Assistant Professor in European Politics at the University of Amsterdam, a Research Fellow at the [Robert Schuman Center of the EUI](https://www.eui.eu/people?id=zbigniew-grzegorz-truchlewski) and Visiting Fellow at the [London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/european-institute). I participate in the [ERC SOLID Project](https://solid-erc.eu) where I work with [Waltraud Schelkle](https://www.lse.ac.uk/european-institute/people/Schelkle-Waltraud), [Maurizio Ferrera](https://maurizioferrera.wordpress.com/en/) and [Hanspeter Kriesi](https://www.eui.eu/people?id=hanspeter-kriesi) and [many other brilliant co-authors](https://solid-erc.eu/team/). 

As a Europeanist and a political economist, I work on EU integration, polity formation, crisis politics and solidarity and austerity (for my publications, see here on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5hv_rE0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and here on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zbigniew-Truchlewski)).

I wrote 2 books with my wonderful co-authors:

- With Hanspeter Kriesi, Ioana-Elena Oana and Alexandru D. Moise, [Pandemic Polity-Building: How Covid-19 Shaped the European Union](https://github.com/zgtruchlewski/PandemicPolity), Oxford University Press, June 2025.
- With Ioana-Elena Oana and Alexandru D. Moise, [Demand for EU Polity Building in the Shadow of the Russian Threat](https://www.cambridge.org/core/elements/demand-for-eu-polity-building-in-the-shadow-of-the-russian-threat/A5D13AB578DED4D35C623B87DA4F8B92), Cambridge University Press, March 2025. 

Previously, I was a Swiss Government Excellence Scholar at the University of Geneva, working with [Thomas Sattler](https://www.thomassattler.org). Iâ€™m a former [Max Weber Fellow](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/max-weber-programme-for-postdoctoral-studies) at the [SPS department](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences) of the EUI, where I was mentored by [Dorothee Bohle](https://www.univie.ac.at/forschung/forschung-im-ueberblick/neue-professuren/neue-professuren/artikel/univ-prof-dr-rer-pol-dorothee-bohle/). I received my PhD from the Central European University (CEU) summa cum laude with no revisions under the supervision of [Achim Kemmerling](https://achimkemmerling.wordpress.com). My PhD was awarded the best doctoral dissertation prize for my work on the social sources of austerity in European Union. At CEU, I chaired the Political Economy Research Group ([PERG](https://politicalscience.ceu.edu/perg)).
