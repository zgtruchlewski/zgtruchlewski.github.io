title: Hello!

---

I am a postdoc at the [London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/european-institute) in the [ERC SOLID Project](https://www.lse.ac.uk/european-institute/research/SOLID) where I work with [Waltraud Schelkle](https://www.lse.ac.uk/european-institute/people/Schelkle-Waltraud). 

Previously, I was a Swiss Government Excellence Scholar at the [University of Geneva](https://www.unige.ch/sciences-societe/speri/), where I collaborated with [Thomas Sattler](http://www.thomassattler.org). I was a [Max Weber Fellow](https://www.eui.eu/ProgrammesAndFellowships/MaxWeberProgramme) with [Dorothee Bohle](https://www.eui.eu/DepartmentsAndCentres/PoliticalAndSocialSciences/People/Professors/Bohle) at the [SPS department](https://www.eui.eu/DepartmentsAndCentres/PoliticalAndSocialSciences) of the European University Institute. I received my PhD from the [Central European University](https://www.ceu.edu) (CEU) summa cum laude with no revisions under the supervision of [Achim Kemmerling](https://achimkemmerling.wordpress.com). My PhD was awarded the best doctoral dissertation prize for my work on the social sources of austerity in the UK and France. At CEU, I chaired the Political Economy Research Group (PERG). 

I have held visiting fellowships at [Cornell University](https://government.cornell.edu), the London School of Economics and the EUI and have worked at the [European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html), the European Commission ([DG ECFIN](https://ec.europa.eu/info/departments/economic-and-financial-affairs)) and the OSCE. I graduated from the Sorbonne (BA), Sciences Po Paris (MA & MRes) and the College of Europe (MA).
