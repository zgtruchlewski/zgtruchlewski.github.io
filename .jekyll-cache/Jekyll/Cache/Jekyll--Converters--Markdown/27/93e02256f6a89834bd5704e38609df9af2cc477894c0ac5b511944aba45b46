<p>As a political economist, I am interested in the politics of macroeconomic policies, austerity politics, the Euro and Central-Eastern Europe and Bayesian statistics. I have <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5hv_rE0AAAAJ&amp;hl=fr">published</a> on the comparative politics of taxation, the political economy of the Euro, the external governance of the Euro, on fiscal policy in Germany and Central-Eastern European politics.</p>
