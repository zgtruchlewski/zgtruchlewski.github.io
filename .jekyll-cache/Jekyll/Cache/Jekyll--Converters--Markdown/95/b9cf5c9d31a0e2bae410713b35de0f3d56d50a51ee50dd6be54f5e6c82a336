I"h<p>Many statistical terms are daunting. They can quickly become confusing. Even scholars themselves do not agree on what some mean. Try asking what a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/not-even-scientists-can-easily-explain-p-values/">p-value is at a conference</a> or, if you want to see academics practice kung-fu, ask them whether one should use fixed or random effects (safety not guaranteed). Many concepts sound alike and statistical learners end up feeling like reading a Russian novel: who is Alexandra Petrovna again? And what is her relation to Peter Alexandrovitch? Sometimes, it is even hard to distinguish statistical concepts from expletives used by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Haddock#Expletives">Captain Haddock</a>. Being a non-native speaker compounds these difficulties. For instance, what does “significant” mean?</p>
